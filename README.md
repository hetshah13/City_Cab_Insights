## **City Cab Insights: NYC Yellow Taxi Dataset**
This project City Cab Insight explores the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset to uncover patterns in ride behavior, fare distribution, high-demand areas, and optimization opportunities for cab services across the city. Through data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, actionable insights are drawn for improving cab operations, customer satisfaction, and profitability. The original dataset consisted of 38.3 million records, which after pre-processing was reduced to 36 million records.
